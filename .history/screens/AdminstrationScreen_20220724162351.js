                  Recent years have seen a large number of universities have
                  been established in Bangladesh. Nevertheless, the increase in
                  the universitiesâ€™ number, students, and faculty do not appear
                  to have been reflected in a similar increase in the quality of
                  education. The vision of University of Global Village (UGV) is
                  to flourish as a prestigious seat of learning in the world. As
                  a center of excellence, it aims at attracting scholars from
                  all around the world and to create a dynamic environment for
                  learning, research and innovation.
